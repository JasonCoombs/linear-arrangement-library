 * @brief Edge iterator class.
 *
 * This class is used to easily iterate over the edges of a graph.
 *
 * This class iterates over the edges of a graph in increasing lexicographic
 * order. For undirected graphs, the edge returned is an edge (u,v) so that
 * the inequality \f$u < v\f$ always holds. For directed graphs, this is not
 * always true. However, the edge returned always has left-to-right direction.
 *
 * Bear in mind, however, that the graph whose edges are being iterated on
 * cannot possibly be modified in any way through this class.
