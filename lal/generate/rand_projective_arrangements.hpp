 *
 * A projective arrangement of a directed rooted tree is one in which the
 * root is not covered by any of the tree's edges and there are no edge
 * crossings.
 * @param t Input directed rooted tree.
 * @param seed Use a random seed for the random number generator.
 * @return Returns a projective arrangement chosen uniformly at random from
 * the space of all projective arrangements of @e t.
 * @pre The object @e t must be a rooted tree (see @ref graphs::rtree::is_rooted_tree).
