/**
 * @brief Random unlabelled free tree generator.
 *
 * Generates uniformly at random unlabelled free trees.
 *
 * Every call to @ref get_tree generates uniformly at random an unlabelled
 * free tree using the algorithm described in \cite Wilf1981a. This is
 * algorithm relies on the @ref ranrut procedure (see \cite Nijenhuis1978a,
 * chapter 29) and runs in about the same time. The implementation of Wilf's
 * paper (see \cite Wilf1981a) in functions @ref get_tree, @ref forest,
 * and @ref bicenter includes the correction pointed out in
 * \cite GiacXcas_Manual (page 38).
 *
 * Users interested in generating trees of large size (of 100 nodes
 * or more) are recommended to take a look at @ref clear method.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		rand_ulab_free_trees TreeGen(n);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *			lal::graphs::free_tree T = TreeGen.get_tree();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode

	 * the values of well-known integer sequences (see attributes @ref m_rn
	 * and @ref m_alpha) that are costly to compute every time they are
	 * needed, they are stored in memory and reused over time.
	 *
	 * So, if the user wants to generate trees of 1000 nodes there will
	 * be too much memory occupied (and unused) if then this class is used
	 * to generate trees of 10 nodes. In cases like this it is
	 * recommended to clear the memory occupied.
	 *
	 * @post After calling this method, the contents of the attributes
	 * @ref m_rn, @ref m_fn and @ref m_alpha are cleared. Attributes
	 * @ref m_rn and @ref m_fn are then assigned the same 31 values that they
	 * are assigned when creating an object of this class.
