 * @brief Exhaustive projective arrangement generator.
 *
 * Generates all projective arrangements of a given rooted tree.
 *
 * The arrangements generated do not take into account the symmetrical
 * arrangements produced by swapping leaves of the tree connected to the
 * same parent. That is, the arrangements produced can be seen as labelled
 * arrangements. Therefore, this class will generate \f$n!\f$ arrangements
 * for all star trees of \f$n\f$ vertices.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		// given a projective tree T
 *		lal::generate::all_projective_arr ArrGen(T);
 *		while (ArrGen.has_next()) {
 *			ArrGen.next();
 *			lal::linearrgmnt arr = ArrGen.get_arrangement();
