 * This class is used to generate rooted directed trees uniformly at random.
 *
 * These trees are generated by first generating uniformly at random a free
 * labelled tree. Then, a node of the generated tree is chosen uniformly at
 * random. This node plays the role of the root of the rooted labelled tree.
 * The edges are oriented away from the root.
