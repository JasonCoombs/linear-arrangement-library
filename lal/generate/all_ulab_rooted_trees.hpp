/**
 * @brief Exhaustive unlabelled rooted tree generator.
 *
 * Generates all the unlabelled rooted trees of a given number of nodes. The
 * algorithm implemented can be found in \cite Beyer1980a. The definition of
 * the public and private members of this class follow the notation in this
 * work.
 *
 * In order to use this class, you must first provide the size \f$n\f$ of the
 * tree (number of nodes) in the constructor or in the @ref init method of
 * the trees to be generated.
 *
 * Then, call method @ref next to modify the internal state that will allow the
 * user to construct the tree by calling method @ref get_tree.
 *
 * All the unlabelled rooted trees have been generated when method @ref has_next
 * returns false. At this point, method @ref get_tree will always construct a
 * star tree of \f$n\f$ nodes rooted at its central node.
 *
 * In order to restart the generation of these trees, call method @ref init
 * again. It is allowed, at any time, to call @ref init with the same size of
 * the trees, or with a different one.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_ulab_rooted_trees TreeGen(n);
 *		while (TreeGen.has_next()) {
 *			TreeGen.next();
 *			lal::graphs::rooted_tree T = TreeGen.get_tree();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
