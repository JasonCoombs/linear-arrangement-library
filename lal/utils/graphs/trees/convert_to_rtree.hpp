 * @brief Converts a linear sequence of a tree to a graph structure.
 *
 * A linear sequence of a tree of @e n nodes is an array of
 * @e n + 1 integers where the values in the positions from 1 to @e n, both
 * included, describe the tree. The value '0' indicates the root, while a
 * strictly positive value indicates parent node.
 * @param L The linear sequence. It must have size @e n + 1.
 * @param n Number of nodes of the tree.
 * @return Returns the rooted tree built with @e L. The tree is an arborescence.
