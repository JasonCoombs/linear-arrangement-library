 * @brief Returns true if, and only if, the graph is a tree.
 *
 * By definition, an undirected graph is a tree if it does not contain
 * cycles and has one single connected component. Note that isloated nodes
 * count as single connected components.
 *
 * In an attempt to extend the usage of this method, directed graphs are
 * also allowed. In this case, since the data structure allows it, the
 * algorithm looks for undirected cycles in the directed graph.
 * @param g Input graph.
