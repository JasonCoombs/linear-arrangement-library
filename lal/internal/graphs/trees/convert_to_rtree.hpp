 * @brief Converts a linear sequence of a tree to a graph structure.
 *
 * The resulting tree is not normalised.
 *
 * A linear sequence of a tree of @e n nodes is an array of @e n integers
 * where the values in the positions from 0 to @e n-1, both included, describe
 * the tree. The value '0' indicates the root, while a strictly positive value
 * indicates the parent node.
 *
 * @param L The linear sequence.
 * @returns The rooted tree built with @e L. The tree is an arborescence.
