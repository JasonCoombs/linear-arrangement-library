 * @brief Abstract class for graphs.
 *
 * Class used as an interface for all types of graphs. This means that this
 * class cannot be instantiated. The classes that can be instantiated are
 * - @ref ugraph : undirected graphs,
 * - @ref dgraph : directed graphs,
 * - @ref ftree : free trees,
 * - @ref rtree : rooted trees.
 *
 * A usual way of initialising classes inheriting from this one is to use one
 * of the @ref init methods available. Depending on the subclass, this method
 * admits either the number of nodes of the graph or a whole other graph and
 * further information (see @ref rtree::init_rooted(const ftree&, node, rtree_type).
 * While these classes' internal memory can be initialised, it can also be cleared
 * using method @ref clear. Each class reimplements this method to carry this
 * task appropriately.
