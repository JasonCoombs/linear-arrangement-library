 * @brief Tree graph class.
 *
 * This class is just a class that inherits from @ref graph so as to allow
 * passing classes that inherit from this class as parameters to functions
 * that only accept attributes of type @ref graph.
 *
 * Classes that implement different abstractions of trees and that inherit from
 * this class are:
 * - @ref utree
 * - @ref dtree
 * - @ref urtree
 * - @ref drtree
 *
 * In these classes the addition of edges is constrained so as to ensure that
 * the edges added actually yield trees, i.e., that cycles are never produced.
 * For the sake of efficiency, only debug compilations of the library
 * (compilations where the DEBUG symbol is defined) check that such additions
 * do not produce cycles. In case of doubt, one can query the class using methods
 * @ref can_add_edge or @ref can_add_edges prior to adding one or more edges.

		 * a vertex is the maximum distance from this vertex to another vertex.
		 * Formally, the eccentricity of a vertex @e u is
		 * \f$ ecc(u) = max_{v\in V} d(u,v) \f$,
		 * where \f$d(u,v)\f$ denotes distance within the graph.
		 *
		 * This function calculates the centre of a tree. In this simpler case,
		 * the centre of a tree \f$T\f$, \f$Z(T)\f$, is the centre of \f$T'\f$
		 * where \f$T'\f$ is the tree resulting from removing \f$T\f$'s leaves.
		 * For other characterisations of centre of a tree see \cite Harary1969a
		 * (chapter 4, page 35).
		 * @return Returns a tuple where the first value gives the size of the
		 * tree's centre (1 or 2 vertices). The second value is always valid,
		 * whereas the second is only valid when the first value equals 2.
