 * @brief Tree graph class.
 *
 * This is an abstract class for those tree-like graphs. Classes that implement
 * different abstractions of trees and that inherit from this class are:
 * @ref free_tree, @ref rooted_tree.
 *
 * In these classes the addition of edges is constrained so as to ensure that
 * the edges added actually yield trees, i.e., that cycles are never produced.
 * For the sake of efficiency, only debug compilations of the library
 * (compilations where the DEBUG symbol is defined) check that such additions
 * do not produce cycles. In case of doubt, one can query the class using methods
 * @ref can_add_edge or @ref can_add_edges prior to adding one or several edges.
