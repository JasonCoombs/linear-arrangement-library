 * @brief Tree graph class.
 *
 * This class is just a class that inherits from @ref graph so as to allow
 * passing classes that inherit from this class as parameters to functions
 * that only accept attributes of type @ref graph.
 *
 * Classes that implement different abstractions of trees and that inherit from
 * this class are:
 * - @ref utree
 * - @ref dtree
 * - @ref urtree
 * - @ref drtree
 *
 * In these classes the addition of edges is constrained so as to ensure that
 * the edges added actually yield trees, i.e., that cycles are never produced.
 * For the sake of efficiency, only debug compilations of the library
 * (compilations where the DEBUG symbol is defined) check that such additions
 * do not produce cycles. In case of doubt, one can query the class using methods
 * @ref can_add_edge or @ref can_add_edges prior to adding one or more edges.
