/**
 * @brief Rooted tree graph class.
 *
 * This class provides its users with an abstraction of rooted trees. Rooted
 * trees are free trees in which one vertex has been designated as the root.
 * Furthermore, in the context of this library, these trees' edges are always
 * oriented towards the leaves (away from the root); this is known as an
 * arborescence. Many methods require objects of this class to be valid rooted
 * trees: the object must be a tree (see @ref is_tree), must have a root (see
 * @ref has_root), and be a valid rooted tree (be an arborescence, that is,
 * see @ref is_orientation_valid).
 *
 * Rooted trees can be constructed in two different ways:
 * - Using an already-constructed free tree via a class constructor, where
 * users have to indicate the root (see @ref rooted_tree(const free_tree&, node)).
 * Alternatively, one can use the method @ref init_rooted, which has the same set
 * of parameters.
 * - Adding edge after edge. In this class, as in @ref free_tree, this addition
 * is constrained so that the underlying undirected graph does not contain cycles.
 * Before (or after) the addition of all the edges, it is recommended
 * the root be set using @ref set_root. If the edges have been added in a
 * systematic fashion -- so it is known whether the tree is an arborescence or
 * not --, it is recommended that the validity of the edges' orientation be set
 * by the user via method @ref set_valid_orientation. If it is not known (or it
 * can't be guaranteed) that the resulting tree is an arborescence, use
 * method @ref find_edge_orientation.
 *
 * Adding edges one by one has a serious drawback. In case the edges do not
 * have a consistent orientation (either always pointing away from the root
 * or always pointing towards it), the resulting graph is not considered to be
 * a valid rooted tree (see @ref is_rooted_tree). Due to efficiency reasons,
 * orientation of edges is not checked before or after their addition. Recall
 * that removal of edges is allowed at every moment.
 *
 * The root allows defining further properties on these graphs. For example,
 * the user can query information regarding subtrees of a particular rooted tree
 * (see methods @ref get_num_nodes_subtree, @ref calculate_size_subtrees,
 * @ref get_edges_subtree, and @ref get_subtree).
 *
 * This class allows flexibility of use of rooted trees regarding the root's
 * choice. Method @ref set_root allows changing the root of rooted trees
 * multiple times and at any time. However, any information dependent
 * on the root becomes invalid upon any change of the root. This information
 * includes, and may not be limited to, the type of rooted tree and the size
 * of the subtrees (see @ref get_num_nodes_subtree). For this reason, is is strongly
 * recommended to build a free tree first and use the constructor
 * @ref rooted_tree(const free_tree&, node), or the method @ref init_rooted,
 * in order to build rooted trees.
