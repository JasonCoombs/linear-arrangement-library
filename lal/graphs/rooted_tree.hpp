/**
 * @brief Rooted tree graph class.
 *
 * This class provides its users with an abstraction of rooted trees. Rooted
 * trees are free trees in which one vertex has been designates as the root.
 * Furthermore, in the context of this library, these trees' edges are directed.
 * Depending on the orientation of the edges with respect to the root, a rooted
 * tree can be of two types:
 * - @ref rtree_type::arborescence, in which the edges are oriented away from
 * the root, or
 * - @ref rtree_type::anti_arborescence, in which the edges are oriented towards
 * the root.
 *
 * Rooted trees can be constructed in two different ways:
 * - Using an already-constructed free tree via a class constructor, where
 * users have to indicate the root and the type of the rooted tree (see
 * @ref rtree(const ftree&, node, rtree_type)). Alternatively, one can use
 * the method @ref init_rooted, which has the same set of parameters.
 * - Adding edge after edge. In this class, as in @ref ftree, this addition is
 * constrained so that the graph the underlying undirected graph does not contain
 * cycles. Before, or after, the addition of all the edges, it is recommended
 * the root be set using @ref set_root. If the edges have been added in a
 * systematic fashion and the type of rooted tree is known, it is recommended
 * to be set by the user via method @ref set_rtree_type. If it is unkown, use
 * method @ref find_rtree_type.
 *
 * Adding edges one by one has a serious drawback. In case the edges do not
 * have a consistent orientation (either always pointing away from the root
 * or always pointing towards it), the resulting graph is not considered to be
 * a valid rooted tree (see @ref is_rooted_tree). Due to efficiency reasons,
 * orientation of edges is not checked before or after their addition. Recall
 * that removal of edges is allwed at every moment.
 *
 * The root allows defining further properties on these graphs. For example,
 * the user can query information regarding subtrees of a particular rooted tree
 * (see methods @ref n_nodes_subtree and @ref recalc_size_subtrees).
 *
 * This class allows flexibility of use of rooted trees regarding the root's
 * choice. Method @ref set_root allows changing the root of rooted trees
 * multiple times and at any time. However, any information dependent
 * on the root becomes invalid upon any change of the root. This information
 * includes, and may not be lmited to, the type of rooted tree (see
 * @ref m_rtree_type) and the size of the subtrees (see @ref m_size_subtrees).
 * For this reason, is is strongly recommended to build a free tree first and
 * use the constructor @ref rtree(const ftree&, node, rtree_type), or the
 * method @ref init_rooted, in order to build rooted trees.
