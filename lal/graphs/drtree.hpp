 * @brief Directed rooted tree class.
 *
 * This class represents a rooted directed tree (see @ref rtree class for information
 * on rooted trees). The edges can be oriented either outwards or inwards (see
 * @ref drtree_type for details).
 *
 * This class can be built in two different ways:
 * - from an undirected tree and by orienting its edges from a chosen node, i.e.,
 * the root (see @ref init_rooted),
 * - by inserting edges one by one or in bulk (see @ref add_edge and @ref add_edges)..
 *
 * In the latter case, the user is recommended to use method @ref find_drtree_type()
 * in order to determine if the tree is an arborescence, an anti-arborescence,
 * or neither (see @ref drtree_type).
