/**
 * @brief Converts a rooted tree into a head vector.
 *
 * A head vector of an @e n-vertex tree is a list of non-negative integer
 * numbers. The number at position @e i denotes the parent node of the vertex
 * at said position. Value '0' denotes the root. In this case, the vertex
 * corresponding to the value '0' is not labelled as a root.
 *
 * Each tree is formatted as a list of whole, positive numbers (including
 * zero), each representing a node of the tree. The number 0 denotes the root
 * of the tree, and a number at a certain position indicates its parent node.
 * For example, when number 4 is at position 9 it means that node 9 has parent
 * node 4. Therefore, if number 0 is at position 1 it means that node 1 is
 * the root of the tree. A complete example of such a tree's representation
 * is the following
 *
 *       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *
 *
 * which should be interpreted as
 *
 *		(a) predecessor:       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *		(b) node of the tree:  1 2 3 4 5 6
 *
 *
 * Note that lines like these are not valid:
 *
 *		(1) 0 2 2 2 2 2
 *		(2) 2 0 0
 *
 *
 * Line (1) is not valid due to a self-reference in the second position,
 * and (2) not being valid due to containing two '0' (i.e., two roots).
 *
 * Methods @ref lal::io::read_head_vector read a head vector from a file in
 * disk.
 * @param t A lal::graphs::rooted_tree.
 * @returns The head vector representation of this tree.
 * @pre Rooted tree @e t must be a rooted tree (see @ref lal::graphs::rooted_tree::is_rooted_tree).
