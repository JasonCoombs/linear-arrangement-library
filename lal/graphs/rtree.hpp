/**
 * @brief Rooted tree class.
 *
 * This class provides its users with an abstraction of rooted trees. This
 * class of trees are similar to regular trees but with an specially labelled
 * vertex that represents the root. However, since it cannot be instantiated,
 * users of the library should use the classes @ref urtree and/or @ref drtree.
 *
 * Moreover, the root allows defining further properties on these graphs. For
 * example, the user can query information regarding subtrees of a particular
 * rooted tree (see methods @ref n_nodes_subtree and
 * @ref urtree::recalc_size_subtrees or @ref drtree::recalc_size_subtrees).
 *
 * This class allows flexibility of use of rooted trees regarding root's
 * choice. Method @ref set_root allows changing the root of rooted trees
 * multiple times and at any time. However, any information dependent
 * on the root becomes invalid upon any change of the root. For example, the
 * size of each subtree of this tree is not valid (see attribute
 * @ref m_recalc_size_subtrees and method @ref need_recalc_size_subtrees)
 * until the tree has a root (see @ref has_root).

		 * The list of edges returned contains labels that depend on the parameter

		 * numbers in \f$[0, n_r)\f$, where \f$n_r\f$ is the number of vertices
		 * of the subtree rooted at @e r, rather than keeping the original
		 * labelling of numbers in \f$[0,n)\f$, where @e n is the number of
		 * vertices of the tree.
		 *
		 * In case of directed trees, the subtree is extracted regardless of the
		 * orientation of the edges. For example, consider an anti-arborescence
		 * of a complete binary tree of 7 vertices, whose edges are
		 * <pre>
		 * 0 <- 1
		 *		1 <- 3
		 *		1 <- 4
		 * 0 <- 2
		 *		2 <- 5
		 *		2 <- 6
		 * </pre>
		 * The edges of the subtree rooted at 1 are "3 -> 1" and "4 -> 1".
		 * Moreover, the orientation of the edges is guaranteed to be
		 * first-vertex-to-second-vertex.
		 *
		 * Regardless of the directedness of the graph, this method can be seen
		 * as a way of relabelling vertices when @e r is the root of the tree
		 * and @e relab is true.
		 * @param r Root vertex of the subtree.
		 * @param relab Should the vertices be relabelled?
		 * @return Returns a list of edges.
		 * @pre This graph is a tree (see @ref is_tree).
		 * @pre This tree has a root (see @ref has_root).

		 * the first edge is guaranteed to be vertex '0'.
