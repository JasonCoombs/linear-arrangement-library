/**
 * @brief Rooted tree graph class.
 *
 * This class provides its users with an abstraction of rooted trees. Rooted
 * trees are similar to free trees but with an specially labelled node that
 * represents the root. Furthermore, in the context of this library, these
 * trees' edges are directed. Depending on the orientation of the edges with
 * respect to the root, the tree can be of two types (see @ref rtree_type for
 * details).
 *
 * Rooted can be constructed in two different ways:
 * - Using an already-constructed free tree via a simple constructor, where
 * users have to indicate the root and the type of the rooted tree (see
 * @ref rtree(const ftree&, node, rtree_type)).
 * - Adding edge after edge. Like in other graphs, edges can be added one by
 * one. In this class, this addition is constrained so that the graph resulting
 * from adding one edge does not contain cycles (when dropping the direction of
 * the edges). Before, or after, the addition of all the edges, it is recommended
 * the root be set using @ref set_root.
 *
 * The root allows defining further properties on these graphs. For example,
 * the user can query information regarding subtrees of a particular rooted tree
 * (see methods @ref n_nodes_subtree and @ref rtree::recalc_size_subtrees).
 *
 * This class allows flexibility of use of rooted trees regarding the root's
 * choice. Method @ref set_root allows changing the root of rooted trees
 * multiple times and at any time. However, any information dependent
 * on the root becomes invalid upon any change of the root. For this reason,
 * is is strongly recommended to build a free tree first and use the constructor
 * @ref rtree(const ftree&, node, rtree_type) in order to build rooted
 * trees.
