/**
 * @brief Rooted tree class.
 *
 * This class provides its users with an abstraction of rooted trees. This
 * class of trees are similar to regular trees but with an specially labelled
 * vertex that represents the root. However, since it cannot be instantiated,
 * users of the library should use the classes @ref urtree and/or @ref drtree.
 *
 * Moreover, the root allows defining further properties on these graphs. For
 * example, the user can query information regarding subtrees of these trees
 * (see methods @ref n_nodes_subtree and @ref calculate_nodes_subtrees).
 *
 * This class allows flexibility of use of rooted trees regarding root's
 * choice. Method @ref set_root allows setting changing the root of rooted
 * trees multiple times and at any time. However, any information dependant
 * on the root becomes invalid upon any change of the root. For example, the
 * size of each subtree of this tree is not valid (see @ref n_nodes_subtree_valid)
 * until the tree has a root (see @ref has_root).
