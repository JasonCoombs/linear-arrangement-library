/**
 * @brief Reads a rooted tree in head vector format.
 *
 * A head vector of an @e n-vertex tree is a list of non-negative integer numbers.
 * The number at position @e i denotes the parent node of the vertex at said
 * position. Value '0' denotes the root. In this case, the vertex corresponding
 * to the value '0' is not labelled as a root.
 *
 * Each tree is formatted as a list of whole, positive numbers (including zero),
 * each representing a node of the tree. The number 0 denotes the root of the
 * tree, and a number at a certain position indicates its parent node. For example,
 * when number 4 is at position 9 it means that node 9 has parent node 4.
 * Therefore, if number 0 is at position 1 it means that node 1 is the root of
 * the tree. A complete example of such a tree's representation is the following
 *
 *       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *
 *
 * which should be interpreted as
 *
 *		(a) predecessor:       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *		(b) node of the tree:  1 2 3 4 5 6
 *
 *
 * Note that lines like these are not valid:
 *
 *		(1) 0 2 2 2 2 2
 *		(2) 2 0 0
 *
 *
 * Line (1) is not valid due to a self-reference in the second position, and (2)
 * not being valid due to containing two '0' (i.e., two roots).
 *
 * The current contents of the graph will be cleared and replaced by
 * the contents of the file.
 * @param filename Name of the file.
 * @param norm Should the graph be normalised? See @ref graphs::graph::is_normalised()
 * @param check_norm If the graph is not to be normalised check whether or
 * not the graph read is normalised.
 * @returns Nothing in case the file does not exist. A free tree if otherwise.
