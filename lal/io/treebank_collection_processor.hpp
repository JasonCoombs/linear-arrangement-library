/**
 * @brief Automatic processing of treebank collections.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "processors",
 * has the goal to ease the processing a whole treebank collection and produce
 * data for a fixed set of features available in the library. See the enumeration
 * @ref lal::io::treebank_feature for details on the features available, and
 * see @ref LAL_concepts__treebank_collection and @ref LAL_concepts__treebank for
 * further details on treebank collections and treebanks.
 *
 * Every processor must be initialised prior to processing the collection. This is done
 * via method @ref init, which requires the path to the main file and the output
 * directory where the results are going to be stored. It also requires a Boolean
 * value indicating whether all (or none) of the features should be used. Moreover,
 * it also admits an optional parameter indicating the number of threads to be
 * used to parallelise the processing of the files.
 *
 * When initialised, a processor can be removed or added features: when the number
 * of features to calculate is low, it can be initialised with no features, and
 * then be added some via method @ref add_feature. Conversely, if the number of
 * features is high, but not all features are needed, a processer can be initialised
 * with all features, and then be removed some of them via method @ref remove_feature.
 *
 * Processing a treebank collection with this class will produce a file for every
 * treebank in the collection. These files can be merged together by indicating so
 * via method @ref set_join_files. A new file will be created, regardless of the
 * number of treebanks in the collection.
 *
 * Finally, the treebank collection is processed via method @ref process. If all the
 * files produced (one for each treebank) are to be joined in a single file, users
 * can give this new file a name by passing it to method @ref process as a string.
 * Also, users can indicate via an optional Boolean parameter whether the individual
 * files are to be removed or not.
 *
 * Method @ref process returns a value of the enumeration @ref treebank_error.
 * Further errors can be checked via methods @ref get_num_errors,
 * @ref get_error_type, @ref get_error_treebank_filename, @ref get_error_treebank_name.
 *
 * The usage of this class is a lot simpler than that of class
 * @ref treebank_collection_reader. For example:
 * @code
 *		treebank_collection_processor tbproc;
 *		// initialise the processor without features (remember to check for errors)
 *      // and 4 threads for faster processing.
 *		tbproc.init(main_file, output_dir, 4);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(lal::io::treebank_feature::num_crossings);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(lal::io::treebank_feature::var_num_crossings);
 *		tbproc.process();
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 * @endcode
