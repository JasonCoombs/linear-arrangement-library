/**
 * @brief A reader for a set of treebank language files.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "readers", is
 * an interface for processing a set of treebanks. It offers the possibility
 * of processing each tree in every treebank file individually, as opposed to
 * class @ref treebank_dataset_processor, which also processes a whole dataset
 * but the information produced is limited to the features available in this
 * library.
 *
 * A treebank dataset is made up of a set of files. Each file contains several
 * syntactic dependency trees (of, e.g., sentences of its corresponding language).
 * These files are referenced within a "main file list", henceforth called the
 * main file. The main file's lines contain only two strings. The first is an
 * identifier (e.g., the ISO code of a language), and the second is the relative
 * path to the file containing the syntactic dependency trees (e.g., the syntactic
 * dependency trees of Arabic in the Stanford dataset). For example, the main
 * file could be called \a stanford.txt and could contain:
 *
 *		arb path/to/file/ar-all.heads2
 *		eus path/to/file/eu-all.heads2
 *		ben path/to/file/bn-all.heads2
 *		...
 *
 * where, again, the first column contains a string referencing the language
 * (e.g., an ISO code, or simply the name of the language), and the second column
 * contains the relative path to the file with the syntactic dependency trees.
 *
 * This reader works as follows: the user has to initialise it with the
 * main file (the main file list). For example, to read the Stanford dataset the
 * reader has to be initialised with the main file \a stanford.txt which could
 * contain the contents examplified above.
 *
 * This class only processes the main file: it iterates through the list
 * of files within the main file using the method @ref next_treebank(). This
 * method can be called as long as method @ref has_treebank() returns true.
 * Each call to @ref next_treebank() builds an internal object of type
 * @ref treebank_reader which allows the user to iterate through the trees
 * within the corresponding file. This object can be retrieved by calling
 * method @ref get_treebank_reader().
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.
 * @code
 *		treebank_dataset tbds;
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 *		tbds.init(mainf)
 *		while (tbds.has_language()) {
 *			// errors are not likely, but it is advisable to check for errors
 *			tbds.next_language();
 *			treebank_reader& tbread = tbds.get_treebank_reader();
 *			// ....
 *		}
 * @endcode
