/**
 * @brief A reader for a collection of treebanks.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "collection readers",
 * is an interface to help you do a custom processing of a set of treebanks. A
 * treebank collection is a set of files, each of which is a treebank. A treebank
 * is a file containing one or more lines, each describing a syntactic dependency
 * tree. If you want to output any of the features already calculated by
 * the library, use class @ref treebank_collection_processor instead; said class
 * is much easier to use and can process treebanks in parallel.
 *
 * Each tree in a treebank file is formatted as a list of whole positive numbers
 * (including zero), each representing a node of the tree. The number 0 denotes
 * the root of the tree, and a number at a certain position indicates its parent
 * node. For example, when number 4 is at position 9 it means that node 9 has
 * parent node 4. Therefore, if number 0 is at position 1 it means that node 1
 * is the root of the tree. A complete example of such a tree's representation
 * is the following
 *
 *       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *
 * which should be interpreted as
 *
 *		predecessor:       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *		node of the tree:  1 2 3 4 5 6
 *
 * Note that lines like these are not valid:
 *
 *		(1) 0 2 2 2 2 2
 *		(2) 2 0 0
 *
 * Line (1) is not valid due to a self-reference in the second position, and (2)
 * not being valid due to containing two '0' (i.e., two roots).
 *
 * A treebank collection reader helps you navigate through a treebank collection. It
 * does the job of initialising the @ref treebank_reader class, which is what
 * you need to do a custom process of a treebank file.
 *
 * Now, the treebank files are referenced within a "main file list", henceforth
 * called the main file. The main file's lines contain only two strings describing
 * a treebank. The first string is a self-descriptive name of the treebank (e.g.,
 * the ISO code of a language), and the second is the relative path to the file
 * containing the syntactic dependency trees (e.g., the syntactic dependency trees
 * of a language in a collection). The path is relative to the directory that contains
 * the main file.
 *
 * For example, the main file could be called \a stanford.txt, representing the
 * Stanford treebank collection, and could contain:
 *
 *		arb path/to/file/ar-all.heads2
 *		eus path/to/file/eu-all.heads2
 *		ben path/to/file/bn-all.heads2
 *		...
 *
 * where the first column contains a string referencing the language (in this case,
 * an ISO code), and the second column contains the relative path to the file
 * with the syntactic dependency trees.
 *
 * The user has to initialise a collection reader with the main file (the main file
 * list). For example, to read the Stanford collection the reader has to be initialised
 * with the main file \a stanford.txt which could contain the contents given
 * above. Bear in mind that a collection reader only processes the main file: it
 * iterates through the list of files within the main file using the method
 * @ref next_treebank. This method can be called as long as method
 * @ref has_treebank returns true. Each call to @ref next_treebank builds an
 * object of class @ref treebank_reader which allows the user to iterate
 * through the trees within the corresponding file. This object can be retrieved
 * by calling method @ref get_treebank_reader.
 *
 * An example of usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.
 * @code
 *		treebank_collection tbds;
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 *		tbds.init(mainf)
 *		while (tbds.has_language()) {
 *			// errors are not likely, but it is advisable to check for errors
 *			tbds.next_language();
 *			treebank_reader& tbread = tbds.get_treebank_reader();
 *			// here goes your custom processing of the treebank
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
