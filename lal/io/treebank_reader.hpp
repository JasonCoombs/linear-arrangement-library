/**
 * @brief Treebank reader class.
 *
 * This class offers a simple interface for iterating over the trees in a single
 * treebank file, henceforth the treebank. Each tree is represented as a list
 * of whole positive numbers (including zero), each representing a vertex of the
 * tree. The number 0 denotes the root of the tree, and number at a certain
 * position indicates its parent vertex. For example, when number 4 is at
 * position 9 it means that vertex 9 has parent vertex 4. Therefore, if number 0
 * is at position 1 it means that vertex 1 is the root of the tree. A complete
 * example of such a tree's representation is the following
 *
 *       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *
 * which should be interpreted as
 *
 *		predecessor:         0 3 4 1 6 3
 *		vertex of the tree:  1 2 3 4 5 6
 *
 * In order to use it, this class has to be first initialised with the treebank
 * file and, optionally, the language it was made from. Once initialised, the
 * user can iterate over the trees within the file by calling @ref next_tree.
 * This function can only be called as long as @ref has_tree returns true.
 * Retrieving the trees is done by calling the function @ref get_tree.
 *
 * If the user did not initialise this class (for example, it was returned by
 * the class @ref treebank_dataset), then method @ref get_treebank_filename
 * and @ref what_language might prove useful for debugging since they return,
 * respectively, the full name (path included) of the treebank and the language
 * it corresponds to.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.
 * @code
 *		auto tbread = treebank_reader();
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 *		tbread.init(main_file);
 *		while (tbread.has_tree()) {
 *			// again, check for errors
 *			tbread.next_tree();
 *			auto t = tbread.get_tree();
 *			// process tree 't'
 *			// ....
 *		}
 * @endcode
