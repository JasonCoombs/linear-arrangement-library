/**
 * @brief A reader for a single treebank language files.
 *
 * This class offers a simple interface for iterating over the trees in a single
 * treebank file, henceforth referred to as the treebank. Each tree is formatted
 * as a list of whole positive numbers (including zero), each representing a node
 * of the tree. The number 0 denotes the root of the tree, and number at a certain
 * position indicates its parent node. For example, when number 4 is at
 * position 9 it means that node 9 has parent node 4. Therefore, if number 0
 * is at position 1 it means that node 1 is the root of the tree. A complete
 * example of such a tree's representation is the following
 *
 *       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *
 * which should be interpreted as
 *
 *		predecessor:       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *		node of the tree:  1 2 3 4 5 6
 *
 * Note that lines like these are not valid:
 *
 *		(1) 0 2 2 2 2 2
 *		(2) 2 0 0
 *
 * Line (1) is not valid due to a self-reference in the second position, and (2)
 * not being valid due to containing two '0' (i.e., two roots).
 *
 * In order to use it, this class has to be first initialized with the treebank
 * file and, optionally, an identifier string. Once initialised, the
 * user can iterate over the trees within the file by calling @ref next_tree.
 * This function can only be called as long as @ref has_tree returns true.
 * Retrieving the trees is done by calling the function @ref get_tree.
 *
 * If an object of this class was returned by the class @ref treebank_dataset_reader,
 * then methods @ref get_treebank_filename and @ref get_identifier might prove
 * useful for debugging since they return, respectively, the full name (path
 * included) of the treebank and the language it corresponds to.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.
 * @code
 *		treebank_reader tbread;
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 *		tbread.init(main_file);
 *		while (tbread.has_tree()) {
 *			// again, check for errors
 *			tbread.next_tree();
 *			const rooted_tree t = tbread.get_tree();
 *			// process tree 't'
 *			// ....
 *		}
 * @endcode
