/**
 * @brief Automatic processing of treebank files.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "processors",
 * has the goal to ease the processing a whole treebank collection and produce
 * data for a fixed set of features available in the library. See the enumeration
 * @ref lal::io::treebank_feature for details on the features available.
 *
 * This class is meant to process a single treebank only. A treebank file is
 * a plain text file that contains several syntactic dependency trees of sentences.
 *
 * Every processor must be initialised prior to processing the treebank file.
 * This is done via method @ref init, which requires the path to the treebank file
 * and the name of the output file (the treebank result) where the results are
 * going to be stored. It also requires a Boolean value indicating whether all
 * (or none) of the features should be used. Processing a treebank file with this
 * class will produce a single file, with as many columns as features added to
 * the processor. The columns are separated with a separating character (see
 * method @ref set_separator); this file will contain a header only if method
 * @ref set_output_header has been called with true). Progress and error messages
 * can be controlled via method @ref set_verbosity.
 *
 * When initialised, features can be added to or removed from the processor: when
 * the number of features to calculate is low, it can be initialised with no
 * features, and then be added some via method @ref add_feature. Conversely, if
 * the number of features is high, but not all features are needed, a processer
 * can be initialised with all features, and then be removed some of them via
 * method @ref remove_feature.
 *
 * Finally, the treebank file is processed via method @ref process. This method
 * returns a value of the enumeration @ref treebank_error.
 *
 * The usage of this class is a lot simpler than that of class
 * @ref treebank_collection_reader. For example:
 * @code
 *		treebank_processor tbproc;
 *		// initialise the processor without features (remmeber to check for errors)
 *		tbproc.init(treebank_input_file, result_filename, "Book_1");
 *		tbproc.add_feature(treebank_processor::tree_feature::num_crossings);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(treebank_processor::tree_feature::var_num_crossings);
 *		tbproc.process();
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 * @endcode
