/**
 * @brief Treebank dataset processor.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "processor", is
 * an interface for processing a whole treebank dataset and produce data for
 * a fixed set of features. It is meant to ease processing treebanks if the
 * features to be calculated are considered in this class. See the enumeration
 * @ref tree_feature for details on the features available. Each feature
 * can be set to be calculated via method @ref add_feature. However, the processor
 * can be initialised with all features set (see @ref init), and then have some
 * of them removed via method @ref remove_feature.
 *
 * A treebank dataset is made up of a set of files, each containing several
 * syntactic dependency trees of sentences of the corresponding language.
 * Each file is referenced within a "main file list", henceforth called the
 * main file. The main file indicates, for each language, a file with the
 * syntactic dependency trees. For example, a main file \a stanford.txt
 * could contain:
 *
 *		arb path/to/file/ar-all.heads2
 *		eus path/to/file/eu-all.heads2
 *		ben path/to/file/bn-all.heads2
 *		...
 *
 * where the first column contains a string referencing the language (e.g., an
 * ISO code, or simply the name of the language), and the second column contains
 * the full path to the file with the syntactic dependency trees. The processor
 * has to be initialised with such file via method @ref init. Then, the treebank
 * is processed via method @ref process.
 *
 * The usage of this class is a lot simpler than that of class @ref treebank_dataset.
 * See code for details.
 * @code
 *		treebank_processor tbproc = treebank_processor();
 *		// initialise the processor without features
 *		tbproc.init(main_file, output_dir, false);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(treebank_processor::tree_feature::C);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(treebank_processor::tree_feature::D_var);
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 *		tbproc.process();
 * @endcode
