/**
 * @brief Treebank dataset processor.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "processor", is
 * an interface for processing a whole treebank dataset. This class offers an
 * automatic way of processing a corpora of treebanks by computing a series of
 * values, available within this library, automatically and outputting all these
 * values into a file, which can be read the same way a csv file can be read.
 *
 * Assume a treebank dataset is a set of files, each containing several syntactic
 * dependency trees of a language. Each file is referenced inside a "main file list",
 * henceforth called the main file. The main file indicates, for each language,
 * its file with the syntactic dependency trees. For example, the main file
 * \a stanford.txt could contain:
 *
 *		arabic stanford/stanford-ar-all.heads2
 *		eus stanford/stanford-eu-all.heads2
 *		ben stanford/stanford-bn-all.heads2
 *		...
 *
 * This processor works as follows: the user has to give the directory
 * in which the main file is located at (henceforth, the parent directory),
 * and the name of this file, without the leading path. For example, to read
 * the dataset \a Documents/datasets/stanford.txt the processor has to be
 * initialised with the parent directory \a Documents/datasets and the
 * main file \a stanford.txt.
 *
 * It is important to notice that the files referenced inside the main
 * must be done so with paths relative to the parent directory. Using the
 * previous example, we could have the following file directory structure:
 *
 *		Documents/
 *		| ...
 *		| datasets/
 *			| ...
 *			| stanford.txt
 *			| stanford/
 *				| stanford-ar-all.heads2
 *				| stanford-eu-all.heads2
 *				| stanford-bn-all.heads2
 *				| ...
 *
 * Therefore, if \a D is the parent directory, \a F is the main file then
 * all the files containing the syntactic dependency trees \a T in the main
 * file \a F must be reachable by concatenating \a D and \a T.
 *
 * The processor will read every language's tree bank, indicated in the main
 * file, and process all trees found. For each language, the processor will
 * compute a list of features (fully described in @ref tree_feature) of every
 * tree in the order that the user provided them via method @ref add_feature.
 * The class will produce an output file for each language inside an output
 * directory, provided by the user. These files will contain as many rows as
 * there are trees in the corresponding tree banks, with one optional row at
 * the begining of the file: the header.
 *
 * The list of features to be computed is, by default, empty, unless stated
 * otherwise in the constructor methods, or in the @ref init.
 *
 * Each output file will be stored in the output directory, which must exist
 * prior to processing the dataset, and they will be named after the language
 * the treebank belongs to.
 *
 * The output files are organised in columns, each corresponding to a feature.
 * The columns will be separated by either a default tab character '\\t', or by
 * any other character chosen by the user. Also, the user may choose not to
 * have a header output at the begining of each file.
 *
 * In order to produce an output, use method @ref process.
