/**
 * @brief Treebank language dataset reader.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "readers", is
 * an interface for processing a list of treebanks. It offers the possibility
 * of processing each tree in every language treebank individually, as opposed
 * to class @ref treebank_processor, which also processes a whole dataset but
 * the information produced is limited to the capabilities of this library.
 *
 * A treebank dataset is made up of a set of files, each containing several
 * syntactic dependency trees of sentences of the corresponding language.
 * Each file is referenced within a "main file list", henceforth called the
 * main file. The main file indicates, for each language, a file with the
 * syntactic dependency trees. For example, the main file \a stanford.txt
 * could contain:
 *
 *		arb path/to/file/ar-all.heads2
 *		eus path/to/file/eu-all.heads2
 *		ben path/to/file/bn-all.heads2
 *		...
 *
 * where the first column contains a string referencing the language (e.g., an
 * ISO code, or simply the name of the language), and the second column contains
 * the full path to the file with the syntactic dependency trees.
 *
 *
 *
 * This reader works as follows: the user has to initialise the reader with the
 * main file (the main file list). For example, to read the Stanford dataset the
 * reader has to be initialised with the main file \a stanford.txt which could
 * contain the contents examplified above.
 *
 * It is important to notice that the files referenced within the main file
 * must be done so with full paths, i.e., paths relative to the system's root.
 *
 * This class only processes the main file: it iterates through the list
 * of files within the main file using the method @ref next_language(). This
 * method can be called as long as method @ref has_language() returns true.
 * Each call to @ref next_language() builds an internal object of type
 * @ref treebank_reader which allows the user to iterate through the trees
 * within the corresponding file. This object can be retrieved by calling
 * method @ref get_treebank_reader().
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is given in the following piece of code.
 * @code
 *		treebank_dataset tbds = treebank_dataset();
 *		// remember to check for errors
 *		tbds.init(mainf)
 *		while (tbds.has_language()) {
 *			// errors are not likely, but it is
 *			// advisable remember to check for errors
 *			tbds.next_language();
 *			treebank_reader tbread = tbds.get_treebank_reader();
 *			while (tbread.has_tree()) {
 *				// again, check for errors
 *				tbread.next_tree();
 *				lal::graphs::urtree t = tbread.get_tree();
 *				// custom processing of tree 't'
 *				// ....
 *			}
 *		}
 * @endcode
