/**
 * @brief Treebank language dataset reader.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "readers", is
 * an interface for processing a list of treebanks. It offers the possibility
 * of processing each tree in every language treebank individually, as opposed
 * to class @ref treebank_processor, which also processes a whole dataset but
 * the information produced is limited to the capabilities of this library.
 *
 * A treebank dataset is made up of a set of files, each containing several
 * syntactic dependency trees of a language. Each file is referenced within
 * a "main file list", henceforth called the main file. The main file indicates,
 * for each language, a file with the syntactic dependency trees. For example,
 * the main file \a stanford.txt could contain:
 *
 *		arabic stanford/stanford-ar-all.heads2
 *		eus stanford/stanford-eu-all.heads2
 *		ben stanford/stanford-bn-all.heads2
 *		...
 *
 * This reader works as follows: the user has to indicate the directory
 * in which the main file is located at (henceforth called the parent directory),
 * and the name of this file, without the leading path. For example, to read
 * the dataset \a Documents/datasets/stanford.txt the reader has to be
 * initialised with the parent directory \a Documents/datasets and the
 * main file \a stanford.txt.
 *
 * It is important to notice that the files referenced within the main file
 * must be done so with paths relative to the parent directory. Using the
 * previous example, we could have the following file directory structure:
 *
 *		Documents/
 *		| ...
 *		| datasets/
 *			| ...
 *			| stanford.txt
 *			| stanford/
 *				| stanford-ar-all.heads2
 *				| stanford-eu-all.heads2
 *				| stanford-bn-all.heads2
 *				| ...
 *
 * Therefore, if \a D is the parent directory and \a F is the main file then
 * all the files containing the syntactic dependency trees \a T referenced
 * within the main file \a F have to be be reachable by concatenating \a D
 * and \a T.
 *
 * This class only processes through main file: it iterates through the list
 * of files within the main file using the method @ref next_language(). This
 * method can be called as long as method @ref has_language() returns true.
 * Each call to @ref next_language() builds an internal object of type
 * @ref treebank_reader which allows the user to iterate through the trees
 * within the corresponding file. This object can be retrieved by calling
 * method @ref get_treebank_reader().
