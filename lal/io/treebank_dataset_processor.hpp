/**
 * @brief Treebank dataset processor.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "processors", has
 * the goal to ease the processing a whole treebank dataset and produce data for
 * a fixed set of features. This is most useful when the features to be calculated
 * are only those available in the library. See the enumeration @ref tree_feature
 * for details on the features available. Since not all features available have
 * to be computed, this class offers the possibility to compute only a subset of
 * them. Each feature can be set to be calculated via method @ref add_feature.
 *
 * A treebank dataset is made up of a set of files, each containing several
 * syntactic dependency trees of sentences. Each file is referred to as a treebank
 * file. Each of these files is referenced within a "main file list", henceforth
 * called the "main file". The main file is a two-column formatted file, the first
 * of which contains a self-descriptive name of the treebank that is indicated in
 * the next column.
 *
 * For example, the main file of a treebank dataset of languages could contain:
 *
 *		arb path/to/file/ar-all.heads2
 *		eus path/to/file/eu-all.heads2
 *		ben path/to/file/bn-all.heads2
 *		...
 *
 * where the first column contains a string referencing the treebank of a language
 * (in this case, by giving an ISO code of a language), and the second column
 * contains the full path to the file with the syntactic dependency trees.
 *
 * Every processor must be initialised prior to processing the files. This is done
 * via method @ref init, which requires the path to the main file and the output
 * directory where the results are going to be stored. Besides these, it also
 * requires a Boolean value indicating whether all (or none) of the features should
 * be used. Moreover, it also admits an optional parameter indicating the number
 * of threads to be used to parallelise the processing of the files. Finally,
 * the treebank dataset is processed via method @ref process which returns a
 * value of the enumeration @ref processor_error. Further errors can be checked
 * via methods @ref get_num_processor_errors, @ref get_error_type,
 * @ref get_error_treebank_filename, @ref get_error_treebank_name.
 *
 * The usage of this class is a lot simpler than that of class
 * @ref treebank_dataset_reader. See code for details.
 * @code
 *		treebank_processor tbproc;
 *		// initialise the processor without features (remmeber to check for errors)
 *      // and 4 threads for faster processing.
 *		tbproc.init(main_file, output_dir, false, 4);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(treebank_processor::tree_feature::C);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(treebank_processor::tree_feature::D_var);
 *		tbproc.process();
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 * @endcode
