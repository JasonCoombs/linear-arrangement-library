/**
 * @brief Automatic processing of treebank datasets.
 *
 * This class, the objects of which will be referred to as the "processors",
 * has the goal to ease the processing a whole treebank dataset and produce
 * data for a fixed set of features available in the library. See the enumeration
 * @ref lal::io::treebank_feature for details on the features available.
 *
 * This class is meant to process a treebank dataset only. A treebank dataset is
 * a set of treebank files, each containing several syntactic dependency trees
 * of sentences. Each file is referred to as a treebank file. Each of these
 * files is referenced within a "main file list", henceforth called the "main
 * file". The main file is a two-column formatted file, the first of which
 * contains a self-descriptive name of the treebank that is indicated in the next
 * column.
 *
 * For example, the main file of a treebank dataset of languages could contain:
 *
 *		arb path/to/file/ar-all.heads2
 *		eus path/to/file/eu-all.heads2
 *		ben path/to/file/bn-all.heads2
 *		...
 *
 * where the first column contains a string referencing the treebank of a language
 * (in this case, by giving an ISO code of a language), and the second column
 * contains the full path to the file with the syntactic dependency trees.
 *
 * Every processor must be initialised prior to processing the dataset. This is done
 * via method @ref init, which requires the path to the main file and the output
 * directory where the results are going to be stored. It also requires a Boolean
 * value indicating whether all (or none) of the features should be used. Moreover,
 * it also admits an optional parameter indicating the number of threads to be
 * used to parallelise the processing of the files.
 *
 * When initialised, a processor can be removed or added features: when the number
 * of features to calculate is low, it can be initialised with no features, and
 * then be added some via method @ref add_feature. Conversely, if the number of
 * features is high, but not all features are needed, a processer can be initialised
 * with all features, and then be removed some of them via method @ref remove_feature.
 *
 * Processing a treebank dataset with this class will produce a file for every
 * treebank in the dataset. These files can be merged together by indicating so
 * via method @ref join_files. A new file will be created, regardless of the number
 * of treebanks in the dataset.
 *
 * Finally, the treebank dataset is processed via method @ref process. If all the
 * files produced (one for each treebank) are to be joined in a single file, users
 * can give this new file a name by passing it to method @ref process as a string.
 * Also, users can indicate via an optional Boolean parameter whether the individual
 * files are to be removed or not.
 *
 * Method @ref process returns a value of the enumeration @ref treebank_error.
 * Further errors can be checked via methods @ref get_num_errors,
 * @ref get_error_type, @ref get_error_treebank_filename, @ref get_error_treebank_name.
 *
 * The usage of this class is a lot simpler than that of class
 * @ref treebank_dataset_reader. For example:
 * @code
 *		treebank_dataset_processor tbproc;
 *		// initialise the processor without features (remmeber to check for errors)
 *      // and 4 threads for faster processing.
 *		tbproc.init(main_file, output_dir, false, 4);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(lal::io::treebank_feature::tree_feature::C);
 *		tbproc.add_feature(lal::io::treebank_feature::tree_feature::D_var);
 *		tbproc.process();
 *		// it is advisable to check for errors
 * @endcode
