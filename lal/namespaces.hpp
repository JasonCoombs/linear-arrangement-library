 /** \mainpage Documentation of LAL, the Linear Arrangement Library
 * 
 * This library offers a variety of algorithms related to linear arrangements of graphs so as to provide to researchers in the field of Quantitative Linguistics a toolset with which they can perform statistical analyses on different corpora of languages efficiently and effectively. Therefore, this library implements several state-of-the-art algorithms and offers a variety of functionalities. While most of the functions have been generalised to be applicable to graphs, we also provide specialised functions for trees, which are more efficient than they more general counterparts.
 * 
 * The main goal of this library is to provide algorithms with which the library's users can use to do statistical studies. One of the most attractive features offered in this library is that of treebank dataset processing. We offer a class that automatically processes a dataset and computes several metrics based on the capabilities of the library. See class @ref lal::io::treebank_dataset_processor for details. We also provide classes for custom processing of treebanks (see @ref lal::io::treebank_dataset_reader and @ref lal::io::treebank_reader).
 * 
 * All the features of syntactic dependency trees that can be calculated with the algorithms in this library are gathered in the namespaces @ref lal::linarr and in @ref lal::properties. These features include, but are not limited to,
 * - the sum of edge lengths \f$D\f$ (see @ref lal::linarr::sum_length_edges), and the expectation and variance of the sum of edge lengths (see @ref lal::properties::expectation_D and lal::properties::variance_D),
 * - calculation of optimal arrangements of free and rooted trees (see @ref lal::linarr::Dmin(const graphs::rooted_tree&, const algorithms_Dmin&) and @ref lal::linarr::Dmin(const graphs::free_tree&, const algorithms_Dmin&)); we have implemented several algorithms (see @ref lal::linarr::algorithms_Dmin),
 * - the number of crossings (see @ref lal::linarr::n_crossings), and the expectation and variance of the number of crossings (see @ref lal::properties::expectation_C and lal::properties::variance_C),
 * - any moment of the degree of the vertices of a graph (@ref lal::properties::mmt_degree),
 * - the mean dependency distance (see @ref lal::linarr::mean_dependency_distance),
 * - the mean dependency distance over ensembles of graphs (see @ref lal::linarr::mean_dependency_distance_1level and @ref lal::linarr::mean_dependency_distance_2level),
 * - the mean hierarchical distance (see @ref lal::properties::mean_hierarchical_distance),
 * - the headedness of a tree (see @ref lal::linarr::headedness),
 * - the type of syntactic dependency trees according the their projectivity (see @ref lal::linarr::classify_tree_structure).
 * 
 * Other algorithms, also gathered in the same namespaces, offer the computation of optimal arrangements. For example, it is offered
 * - the computation of the minimal arrangements with respect to the sum of edge lengths (see @ref lal::linarr::Dmin), with free choice on the algorithm to be used (see @ref lal::linarr::algorithms_Dmin).
 * 
 * As extra features, useful for experimentation, are the generation of different types of trees, all of which are available in the @ref lal::generate namespace. We have implemented existing techniques (cited accordingly) or made or own to enumerate
 * - all labelled/unlabelled free trees,
 * - all unlabelled rooted trees,
 * - all projective arrangements of rooted trees,
 * 
 * and to generate uniformly at random
 * 
 * - labelled/unlabelled free/rooted trees,
 * - projective arrangements of rooted trees.
 * 
 * The documentation of each class include usage examples.
 * 
 * \section s1 The basic data structures in this library
 * 
 * In order to be able to use the library comfortably, its users must take good note of the different data structures that are the library's core.
 * 
 * \subsection ss1_s1 Exact integer and rational arithmetic
 * 
 * Most operations in this library are done using exact integer and rational arithmetic. Such arithmetic is powered by the GMP library (see \cite GMP_library). We have wrapped their C structures into the classes @ref lal::numeric::integer and @ref lal::numeric::rational.
 * 
 * \subsection ss3_s1 The different types of graphs
 * 
 * As it should be expected, this library offers a number of different graph abstractions: undirected graphs (see @ref lal::graphs::undirected_graph), directed graphs (see @ref lal::graphs::directed_graph), free trees (see @ref lal::graphs::free_tree) and roted trees (see @ref lal::graphs::rooted_tree), all of which can be found within the @ref lal::graphs namespace.
 * 
 * \subsubsection sss1_ss3_s1 The internal structure of graphs
 * 
 * Although all graphs should be regarded as unlabelled, each node carries an implicit labelling. Such labelling has a most trivial nature since each node is labelled with a number between 0 and the total number of vertices minus 1.
 * 
 * Due to most graphs being sparse, the data structure of choice are adjacency lists where each vertex has a list of neighbouring nodes, or simply neighbours, associated to it. The user can affect the order of appearance of neighbours in multiple ways. One of them is, evidently, the order in which edges are added. Another way is via the @ref lal::graphs::graph::normalise function, which sorts every list of neighbours increasingly. By default, the addition of edges is normalising, namely the following code
 * @code
 * lal::graphs::free_tree t(4);
 * t.add_edge(0,1,false).add_edge(0,3,false).add_edge(0,2,false);
 * t.normalise();
 * cout << t << endl;
 * @endcode
 * produces the same output as
 * @code
 * lal::graphs::free_tree t(4);
 * t.add_edge(0,1).add_edge(0,3).add_edge(0,2);
 * cout << t << endl;
 * @endcode
 * which is
@verbatim
0: 1 2 3
1: 0
2: 0
3: 0
@endverbatim
 * The output is easy to interpret: the first line indicates the nodes are incident to vertex 0, the second line indicates the nodes incident to vertex 1, and so on. Without normalisation, the output is
@verbatim
0: 1 3 2
1: 0
2: 0
3: 0
@endverbatim
 * where only the first line changes.
 * 
 * Such normalisation is required by some of the algorithms in this library. Without proper normalisation, the algorithms are not likely to compute correct values. The parameter that governs the graphs' normalisation is called the normalisation parameter.
 * 
 * The adjacency list structure has been extended to directed graphs in a way that the user can query them for in-degree (see @ref lal::graphs::directed_graph::in_degree) and in-neighbours (see @ref lal::graphs::directed_graph::get_in_neighbours).
 * 
 * \section s2 Basic terminology and notation
 * 
 * The user will note, after browsing through the capabilities of the library, that several concepts are quite ubiquitous. The @ref lal::node type is simply a typedef of an unsigned integer type, and the @ref lal::edge type is simply a STL's pair of nodes.
 * 
 * A more advanced concept is that of linear arrangement (see @ref lal::linear_arrangement). In this library, a linear arrangement is viewed as a function that relates each node to a position in a linear sequence. Due to the properties of such functions, a linear arrangement is implemented with the STL's vector. Note that the concept of linear arrangement has been detached from that of trees, and the pair of a linear arrangement and a tree forms, in the context of the library, a syntactic dependency tree (this is why this class is not implemented). The symbol of choice for representing a linear arrangement in the library is the greek letter for the number pi \f$\pi\f$.
 * 
 * Now, many functions (see those fuctions within the @ref lal::linarr namespace) admit a linear arrangement which can be empty. Whenever it is empty, i.e., the value of the parameter is an empty vector, the positions of the nodes of the graphs in question are given by their implicit label. Such empty arrangement is called, in the context of the library, the identity arrangement symbolised with \f$\pi_I\f$. Therefore, the following measurement of the sum of the lengths of the edges are equivalent
 * @code
 * lal::graphs::free_tree t(4);
 * t.add_edges({edge(0,1), edge(1,2), edge(2,3)});
 * uint32_t D1 = linarr::sum_length_edges(t);
 * uint32_t D2 = linarr::sum_length_edges(t, {0,1,2,3});
 * @endcode
 * The possibility of expliciting a linear arrangement increases the flexibility of the library. For example, for the purposes of illustration, one can calculate the expected sum of the length of the edges as follows
 * @code
 * lal::graphs::free_tree t(4);
 * t.add_edges({edge(0,1), edge(1,2), edge(2,3)});
 * lal::numeric::rational Dt = 0;
 * lal::linearrgmnt arr = {0,1,2,3};
 * do {
 * 		Dt += linarr::sum_length_edges(t, arr);
 * }
 * while (std::next_permutation(arr.begin(), arr.end());
 * Dt /= 24;
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Throughout the library we refer to the sum of length of edges with a capital D, \f$D\f$, and we refer to the number of crossings with a capital C, \f$C\f$.
 * 
 * \section s3 Using the library effectively
 * 
 * As a rule of the thumb, the user is encouraged not to change the default value of the parameters whenever they are given. However, certain operations can be less efficient than others, and sometimes it is even desirable to use values different from the default ones.
 * 
 * One the one hand, the wrong choice of operation can affect the library's performance gravely. For example, the addition/deletion of edges to/from graphs is slower when it is done edge by edge. Users are highly encouraged to add/delete them in bulk using the appropriate functions (see, for example, @ref lal::graphs::undirected_graph::add_edges and @ref lal::graphs::undirected_graph::remove_edges). The following code is discouraged
 * @code
 * lal::graphs::utree t(10);
 * node u, v;
 * for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {
 * 		cin >> u >> v;
 * 		t.add_edge(u,v);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * while the next piece of code is strongly encouraged whenever possible
 * @code
 * lal::graphs::utree t(10);
 * vector<edge> e(9);
 * for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {
 * 		cin >> e[i].first >> e[i].second;
 * }
 * t.add_edges(e);
 * @endcode
 * A similar reasoning should be applied to the deletion of edges.
 * 
 * On the other hand, graphs are seldom required to be normalised. For example, when calculating the variance of \f$C\f$ (see @ref lal::properties::variance_C), it is mandatory that the graph be normalised, namely, the function has a precondition that requires the graph to be normalised. If such a function is to be called eventually then add all edges in bulk and with normalisation, or read the graph from disk also with normalisation. However, if such functions will never be called then the users are encouraged to set the normalisation parameter to false. For example, if the variance of \f$C\f$ is to be calculated,
 * @code
 * lal::graphs::free_tree t;
 * lal::io::read_edge_list(t);
 * double var_C = lal::properties::variance_C(t);
 * @endcode
 * but if not
 * @code
 * lal::graphs::free_tree t;
 * lal::io::read_edge_list(t, false);
 * // ...
 * @endcode

namespace lal {

/**
 * @brief Namespace generating different classes of objects.
 * 
 * This namespace contains algorithms for the generation of trees and of arrangements.
 *
 * \section gen_trees Generating trees
 *
 * The classes that generate trees have a self-explanatory format:
 *
 * @verbatim
1_2_3_trees
   @endverbatim
 *
 * The numbers are placeholders for the following:
 *
 * - 3: rooted/free -- Generate rooted or free trees.
 *
 * - 2: lab/ulab -- Generate labelled or unlabelled free/rooted trees.
 *
 * - 1: rand/all -- Indicates whether the generation is to be random (rand) or
 * exhaustive (all). An exhaustive generation will enumerate all lab/ulab rooted/free
 * trees whereas random generation generate trees unformly at random.
 *
 * Therefore, the class @ref rand_lab_rooted_trees generates random labelled rooted
 * trees uniformly at random, and the class @ref all_ulab_free_trees should be
 * used to enumerate all unlabelled free trees.
 *
 * All classes for tree generation return trees that are preprocessed. This
 * preprocessing varies depending on whether the tree is rooted or free. The full
 * preprocessing details can be checked in class @ref tree_gen, from which all
 * these classes inherit.
 *
 * Using these classes is straightforward. To generate trees uniformly at random:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::rand_2_3_trees TreeGen(n);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *			const lal::graphs::3_tree T = TreeGen.get_tree();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * To enumerate all trees:
 * @code
 *		lal::generate::all_2_3_trees TreeGen(n);
 *		while (TreeGen.has_next()) {
 *			TreeGen.next();
 *			const lal::graphs::3_tree T = TreeGen.get_tree();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * (remember to replace the numbers in the actual code!).
 *
 * \remark In this documentation you will find 8 classes for random generation of
 * trees. Users should refrain from using those starting with '__' as the trees
 * returned by these classes are not preprocessed. However, if one wishes to know
 * the implementation details (as for algorithms implemented, and the papers cited),
 * please, read the documentation of said classes.
 *
 * \section gen_arrangements Generating arrangements
 *
 * This namespace contains classes for the generation of arrangements <b>of a
 * given tree</b>. Depending on the type of arrangements, the given tree should
 * be free or rooted accordingly.
 *
 * Again, the names for these classes are also self-explanatory:
 * @verbatim
1_2_arrangement
   @endverbatim
 *
 * The numbers are placeholders for the following:
 *
 * - 2: projective -- Indicates whether the generated arrangements should be
 * projective.
 *
 * - 1: rand/all -- As before, this indicates whether the generation is to be
 * random (rand) or exhaustive (all). An exhaustive generation will enumerate
 * all arrangements
 *
 * Therefore, the class @ref rand_projective_arrangements generates random
 * projective arrangements of a tree, and the class @ref all_projective_arrangements
 * should be used to enumerate all projective arrangements of a tree.
 *
 * Using these classes is straightforward. To generate trees uniformly at random:
 * @code
 *		// given a tree T (of the appropriate type -- indicated with the '2')
 *		lal::generate::rand_2_arrangement ArrGen(T);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *			const lal::linear_arrangement arr = ArrGen.make_rand_arrgmnt();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * To enumerate all arrangements:
 * @code
 *		// given a tree T (of the appropriate type -- indicated with the '2')
 *		lal::generate::all_2_arrangement ArrGen(T);
 *		while (ArrGen.has_next()) {
 *			ArrGen.next();
 *			const lal::linearrgmnt arr = ArrGen.get_arrangement();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
 * (remember to replace the numbers in the actual code!).
 *
 * \remark In all cases, the arrangements generated are considered to be labelled,
 * i.e., there are no symmetries taken into account when it comes to enumerating
 * or generating uniformly at random said arrangements. For example, for an
 * \f$n\f$-vertex star tree, the class @ref all_projective_arrangements
 * will enumerate \f$n!\f$ arrangements.

/**
 * @brief Linear arrangements namespace.
 * 
 * This namespace contains functions to calculate properties of graphs that
 * depend on a linear arrangement. Said arrangement van be given explicitly,
 * i.e., by constructing a @ref linear_arrangement object, or by omitting it
 * in the functions to let these use the labelling of the graph. For example,
 * given a graph
 * @code
 *		lal::graphs::undirected_graph g;
 * @endcode
 * we can calculate the sum of length of the edges using function
 * @ref sum_length_edges in two different ways. The first is by omitting the
 * arrangement:
 * @code
 *		lal::linarr::sum_length_edges(g);
 * @endcode
 * or by giving one explicitly
 * @code
 *		lal::linarr::sum_length_edges(g, {...});
 * @endcode
 *
 * A linear arrangement object is a vector whose size is equal to the number of
 * nodes of its corresponding graph. Note, however, that a linear arrangement has
 * no associated graph; it is just a vector. Throughout this namespace we use the
 * symbol for the number pi, \f$\pi\f$ to denote a linear arrangement, as is usually
 * done in the scientific literature.
 *
 * The contents of a @ref linear_arrangement object are as follows: if \f$\pi\f$
 * is a linear arrangement then the @e u-th position of \f$\pi\f$ contains the
 * position of that node in the arrangement. Formally, \f$\pi[u] = p\f$ if, and
 * only if, node @e u is at position @e p in the linear arrangement.
 *
 * The identity arrangement \f$\pi_I\f$ is a special case of linear arrangement
 * used in many functions. Such an arrangement is one that maps each node into
 * the position corresponding to their label, i.e., \f$ \pi_I(u) = u\f$. When
 * omitting the arrangement in the functions of this namespace, the user should
 * consider that the arrangement used is the identity arrangement.
