 * 
 * This namespace contains the data structures that implement graphs. Note that,

 * carry a label, a number between 0 and \f$n-1\f$, where \f$n\f$ is the number

 * - Edge list. See functions @ref read_edge_list(const std::string&, graphs::ugraph&, bool)
 * and @ref read_edge_list(const std::string&, graphs::dgraph&, bool).
 * 
 * Other features contained in this namespace are:
 * - Processing of whole corpora of treebanks automatically (see @ref io::treebank_processor)

 * - Custom processing of single treebank files (see @ref io::treebank_reader)

/**
 * @brief Linear arrangements namespace.
 * 
 * This namespace contains all operations related to linear arrangements.
 * 
 * All linear arrangements are vectors of as many vertices as the
 * corresponding graph has. If \f$\pi\f$ is a linear arrangement then
 * the @e u-th position of \f$\pi\f$ contains the position of that vertex in
 * the arrangement. Formally, \f$\pi[u] = p\f$ if, and only if, vertex @e u
 * is at position @e p in the linear arrangement.
 *
 * The identity arrangement \f$\pi_I\f$ is a special case of linear arrangement
 * used in many functions. Such an arrangement is one that maps each vertex
 * into the position corresponding to their label, i.e., \f$ \pi_I(u) = u\f$.
 * 
 * This namespace contains the computation of:
 * - the number of crossings \f$C\f$ (see @ref n_crossings).
 * - the sum of the length of edges \f$D\f$.
 * - the headedness of directed graphs (see @ref headedness).
 * - the Mean Dependency Distance for single trees (see @ref MDD).
 * 
 * It also contains methods for the classification of trees into projective
 * classes (see @ref tree_structure_type for the supported classes and
 * @ref get_tree_structure_type for the function to classify the trees).
