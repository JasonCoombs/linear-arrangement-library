 * @brief Linear arrangements namespace.

 * This namespace holds all operations related to linear arrangements.

 * All linear arrangements are vectors of as many nodes as the
 * corresponding graph has. If \f$\pi\f$ is a linear arrangement then
 * the @e u-th position of \f$\pi\f$ contains the position of that node in
 * the arrangement. Formally, \f$\pi[u] = p\f$ if, and only if, node @e u
 * is at position @e p in the linear arrangement.
 * 
 * For example, it contains:
 * - Computation of the number of crossings \f$C\f$.
 * - Computation of the sum of the length of edges \f$D\f$.
 * - Computation of headedness of directed graphs.
 * - Classification of trees into classes (see @ref tree_structure_type).
