@brief Set of utilities.

This namespace contains several utilities for the library, useful for experimentation. This includes the following functions:

- Isomorphism tests. For free trees (see @ref lal::utilities::are_trees_isomorphic(const lal::graphs::free_tree&,const lal::graphs::free_tree&)) and for rooted trees (see @ref lal::utilities::are_trees_isomorphic(const lal::graphs::rooted_tree&,const graphs::rooted_tree&)).
