/**
 * @brief Iterator over the set \f$Q\f$ of a graph.
 *
 * This class is used to easily iterate over the elements of the set \f$Q\f$
 * of a graph.
 *
 * This class iterates over the independent pairs of edges of a graph. For
 * undirected graphs, the edges of the pair returned are edges \f$(u,v)\f$
 * so that the inequality \f$u < v\f$ always holds. For directed graphs, this
 * is not always true, since the edges returned always has left-to-right direction.
 *
 * Bear in mind, however, that this class does not modify in any way the
 * graph it is initialised with.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		Q_iterator it(g);
 *		while (it.has_next()) {
 *			it.next();
 *			edge_pair q = it.get_pair();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
