/**
 * @brief Iterator over the set of edges.
 *
 * This class is used to easily iterate over the edges of a graph.
 *
 * This class iterates over the edges of a graph. For undirected graphs, the
 * edge returned is an edge \f$(u,v)\f$ so that the inequality \f$u < v\f$
 * always holds. For directed graphs, this is not always true since the edge
 * returned always has left-to-right orientation.
 *
 * Bear in mind, however, that this class does not modify in any way the
 * graph it is initialised with.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		E_iterator it(g); // g is a graph
 *		while (it.has_next()) {
 *			it.next();
 *			edge e = it.get_edge();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
