 * @brief Computes the sum of the length of the edges in a linear arrangement.
 *
 * Given a graph and a permutation of its vertices, computes the sum of the
 * length of the graph's edges in the arrangement. If the arrangement is not
 * specified, the identity arrangement is used.
 * @param g Input graph.
 * @param arr Permutation of the vertices. If @e arr[p] = u then
 * node @e u is placed in position @e p of the arrangement.
 * @return Returns \f$D\f$.
