 * @brief Computes the headedness of a directed graph as an exact rational number.

 * Given a graph and a permutation of its vertices, computes the ratio of
 * right-branching edges over the total amount of edges. More precisely, computes
 *
 * \f$h = \frac{r}{m}\f$
 *
 * where \f$r\f$ is the number of right-branching edges and \f$m\f$ is the number
 * of edges of the graph.
 *
 * A value of 0 indicates perfect left branching, and a value of 1 indicates
 * perfect right-branching.
 * @param g Input graph.
 * @param pi Permutation of the vertices. If \f$\pi[u]=p\f$ then
 * node @e u is placed in position @e p of the arrangement.
