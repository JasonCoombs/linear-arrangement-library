 * @brief Algorithm to calculate optimal projective arrangements of rooted trees.
 *
 * Computes an optimal projective linear arrangement for rooted trees.
 * A projective linear arrangement is an arrangement in which there are
 * no edge crossings and the root is not covered by any edge.
 *
 * This option uses Gildea's and Temperley's algorithm published in \cite Gildea2007a.
 *
 * @param t Input rooted tree.
 * @pre The object must be a tree (see @ref graphs::rtree::is_tree).
 * @pre The tree must have a root (see @ref graphs::rtree::has_root).
 * @pre The tree must be an arborescence (see
 * @ref graphs::rtree::rtree_type_valid and
 * @ref graphs::rtree::get_rtree_type).
 * @pre The tree must have the size of its subtrees calculated (see
 * @ref graphs::rtree::need_recalc_size_subtrees).
