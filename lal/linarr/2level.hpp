/**
 * @brief Computes the 2-level Mean Dependency Distance over an ensemble of graphs.
 *
 * Given a list of graphs and a linear arrangement of the nodes for each of
 * them, computes the 2-level Mean Dependency Distance, i.e., it computes the
 * average Mean Dependency Distance of the graphs in the list.
 *
 * Formally, given a list of linear arrangements \f$\Pi = \{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^k\f$
 * and a list of graphs \f$G = \{G_i\}_{i=1}^k\f$, computes \f$(1/k)S_{<d>}\f$,
 * where \f$S_{<d>} = \sum_{i=1}^k MDD(G_i, \pi_i)\f$ is the sum of the mean
 * dependency distances of every graph (see @ref MDD_rational for details on
 * the definition of the Mean Dependency Distance).
 *
 * @param Gs List of input graphs.
 * @param pis List of linear arrangements of the nodes \f$\Pi = \{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^k\f$.
 * When omitted, \f$\pi_I\f$ is used for all graphs.
 * @return Returns Jing's and Liu's 2-level \f$MDD\f$ for an ensemble of graphs.
