 * We can currently identify the following structures:
 * - Projective structures (see @ref tree_structure::projective),
 * - Planar structures (see @ref tree_structure::planar),
 * - Well nested trees with maximum degree gap 1 (see @ref tree_structure::WG1),
 * - 1-Endpoint Crossing (see @ref tree_structure::EC1),
 * - Multi-headed 4 (see @ref tree_structure::MH4),
 * - Multi-headed 5 (see @ref tree_structure::MH5),
