/**
 * @brief The different types of syntactic dependency tree structures.
 *
 * Given a tree (not necessarily directed) and a linear arrangement of
 * its vertices, we can classify the tree in several different classes.
 *
 * We can currently identify the following structures:
 * - Projective structures (see @ref tree_structure_type::projective). A
 * structure is projective if it is planar and the root is not covered by any
 * dependency.
 * - Planar structures (see @ref tree_structure_type::planar). A structure is
 * planar if none of its dependencies cross. Two dependencies \f$(s,t), (u,v)\f$
 * cross if, and only if, their positions in the arrangement are interleaved,
 * i.e., if \f$\pi(s) < \pi(u) < \pi(t) < \pi(v)\f$, assuming that \f$s\f$
 * precedes \f$t\f$ and \f$u\f$ precedes \f$v\f$ in the arrangement.
 * - Well nested trees with maximum degree gap \f$k\f$, usually denoted as
 * \f$WG_k\f$. We support:
 *		- \f$WG_i\f$ (for \f$1\le i \le 10\f$, see
 *		@ref tree_structure_type::WG_1, ..., @ref tree_structure_type::WG_10).
 *		- \f$WG_k\f$ (for \f$k > 10\f$, see @ref tree_structure_type::WG_k).
 * - 1-Endpoint Crossing (see @ref tree_structure_type::EC_1). A structure has
 * the property of being 1-endpoint crossing if, given any dependency, all
 * other dependencies crossing it are incident to a common node.
