/**
 * @brief Computes the 1-level Mean Dependency Distance over an ensemble of graphs.
 *
 * Given a list of graphs \f$L_i\f$ and a linear arrangement of the nodes for
 * each of them, computes the 1-level Mean Dependency Distance as the quotient
 * of \f$D\f$, the sum of all the \f$D_i\f$, where \f$D_i\f$ is the sum of the
 * edge lengths of the \f$i\f$-th graph, and of \f$M\f$ the sum of the number
 * of edges of all the graphs.
 *
 * Formally, given a list of linear arrangements \f$\Pi = \{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^k\f$
 * and a list of graphs \f$G = \{G_i\}_{i=1}^k\f$, computes \f$D/M\f$, where
 * - \f$D = \sum_{i=1}^k D(G_i, \pi_i)\f$ is the sum of edge lengths of every
 * graph.
 * - \f$M = \sum_{i=1}^k |E(G_i)|\f$ is the sum of the number of edges of every
 * graph.
 * @param Gs List of input graphs.
 * @param pis List of linear arrangements of the nodes \f$\Pi = \{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^k\f$.
 * When omitted, \f$\pi_I\f$ is used for all graphs.
 * @return Returns Jing's and Liu's 1-level \f$MDD\f$ for an ensemble of graphs.
