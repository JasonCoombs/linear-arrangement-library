 * @brief A linear arrangement of the nodes of a graph.
 *
 * If @e pi is a linear arrangement of @e n nodes:
 * @code
	lal::linearrgmnt pi(n);
 * @endcode
 * then the @e u-th position gives the position of node @e u
 * in the arrangement:
 * @code
	position pu = pi[u];
 * @endcode
 * 
 * For the sake of simplicity, we refer to the arrangement \f$ \pi[i]=i \f$,
 * where \f$i\f$ denotes both the nodes of the graph and a position in the
 * linear arrangement, as the identity arrangement and is denoted by \f$\pi_I\f$.

/**
 * @brief A head vector representation of a (usually rooted) tree.
 *
 * A head vector of an @e n-vertex tree is a list of non-negative integer
 * numbers. The number at position @e i denotes the parent node of the vertex
 * at said position. Value '0' denotes the root. In this case, the vertex
 * corresponding to the value '0' is not labelled as a root.
 *
 * Each tree is formatted as a list of whole, positive numbers (including
 * zero), each representing a node of the tree. The number 0 denotes the root
 * of the tree, and a number at a certain position indicates its parent node.
 * For example, when number 4 is at position 9 it means that node 9 has parent
 * node 4. Therefore, if number 0 is at position 1 it means that node 1 is
 * the root of the tree. A complete example of such a tree's representation
 * is the following
 *
 *       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *
 *
 * which should be interpreted as
 *
 *		(a) predecessor:       0 3 4 1 6 3
 *		(b) node of the tree:  1 2 3 4 5 6
 *
 *
 * Note that lines like these are not valid:
 *
 *		(1) 0 2 2 2 2 2
 *		(2) 2 0 0
 *
 *
 * Line (1) is not valid due to a self-reference in the second position,
 * and (2) is not valid since it contains two '0' (i.e., two roots).
