 * @brief A linear arrangement of the nodes of a graph.
 *
 * If @e pi is a linear arrangement of @e n nodes:
 * @code
	lal::linearrgmnt pi(n);
 * @endcode
 * then the @e u-th position gives the position of node @e u
 * in the arrangement:
 * @code
	position pu = pi[u];
 * @endcode
 * 
 * For the sake of simplicity, we refer to the arrangement \f$ \pi[i]=i \f$,
 * where \f$i\f$ denotes both the nodes of the graph and a position in the
 * linear arrangement, as the identity arrangement and is denoted by \f$\pi_I\f$.
