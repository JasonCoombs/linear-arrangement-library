 * @brief Calculate the centroid of a rooted tree.

 * of (at most) two vertices that have minimum eccentricity. The centroid is the
 * set of (at most) two vertices that have minimum weight, where the weight is
 * the maximum size of the subtrees rooted at that vertex. In both case, if
 * the set has two vertices then they are adjacent in the tree. See \cite Harary1969a
 * (pages 35-36) for further details.
 * @param t Input tree.
 * @returns A tuple of two values: the nodes in the centre. If the tree has a
 * single central node, only the first node is valid and the second is assigned
 * an invalid vertex index. It is guaranteed that the first vertex has smaller
 * index value than the second.
 * @pre Method graphs::rooted_tree::is_rooted_tree returns true.
