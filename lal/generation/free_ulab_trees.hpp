/**
 * @brief Exhaustive free unlabelled tree generator.
 *
 * Generates all the nonisomorphic free unlabelled trees
 * of a certain size.
 *
 * In order to use this class, the user must first provide
 * the size \f$n\f$ in the constructor or in the @ref init
 * method of the trees to be generated (number of vertices).
 *
 * Then, call method @ref next to modify the internal state
 * that will allow the user to construct the tree by calling
 * method @ref get_tree.
 *
 * All the free nonisomorphic unlabelled trees are generated when
 * method @ref has_next returns false. At this point, method
 * @ref get_tree will always construct a star tree of @e n vertices.
 *
 * In order to restart the generation of these trees, call
 * method @ref init again. It is allowed, at this point, and
 * at any time, to call @ref init with the same size of the
 * trees, or with a different one.
 *
 * The algorithm implemented can be found in the work by Wright
 * et al. (see \cite Wright1986a). The definition of the public
 * and private members of this class follow the notation in this work.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		free_lab_trees flt(n);
 *		while (flt.has_next()) {
 *			flt.next();
 *			ugraph e = it.get_tree();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode
