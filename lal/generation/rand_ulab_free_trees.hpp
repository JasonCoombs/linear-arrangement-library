 * @brief Random unlabelled free tree generator.
 *
 * Generates uniformly at random free unlabelled trees.
 *
 * Every call to @ref make_rand_tree generates uniformly at random a free
 * unlabelled tree using the algorithm described in \cite Wilf1981a.
 * This is algorithm relies on the @e ranrut procedure (see \cite Nijenhuis1978a,
 * chapter 29) and runs in about the same time. The implementation of Wilf's
 * paper (see @ref make_rand_tree, @ref forest, and @ref bicenter) includes
 * the correction in Wilf's paper, as pointed out in \cite CorrectionWilf.
 *
 * Users interested in generating trees of large size (of 100 vertices
 * or more) are recommended to take a look at @ref clear method.
 *
 * The correct usage of this class is
 * @code
 *		rand_ulab_free_trees TreeGen(n);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *			utree T = TreeGen.make_rand_tree();
 *			// ...
 *		}
 * @endcode

		 * and @ref m_alpha) that are costly to compute every time they are
		 * needed, they are stored in memory and reused over time.
		 *
		 * So, if the user wants to generate trees of 1000 vertices there will
		 * be too much memory occupied (and unused) if then this class is used
		 * to generate trees of 10 vertices. In cases like this it is
		 * recommended to clear the memory occupied.
		 *
		 * @post After calling this method, the contents of the attributes
		 * @ref m_rn, @ref m_fn and @ref m_alpha are cleared. Attributes
		 * @ref m_rn and @ref m_fn are then assigned the same 31 values that they
