# Linear Arrangement Library

This library implements several algorithms to solve problems related to these
arrangements:

- Calculation of the variance of the number of crossings.
- Efficient algorithms to compute the number of crossings.

This library offers special functions for trees, a data structure commonly used in many fields.

The library also provides functions for:

- Random generation of labelled and unlabelled free trees.
- Deterministic (and exhaustive) generation of labelled and unlabelled free trees.

## Installation of the library

We wrote different sets of instructions for installing LAL for

- Windows in [this](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/linear-arrangement-library/blob/master/instructions/installation-library-windows.md) file.
- Linux in [this](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/linear-arrangement-library/blob/master/instructions/installation-library-linux.md) file.

## Python interface

We wrote different sets of instructions for installing LAL's Python interface for

- Windows in [this](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/linear-arrangement-library/blob/master/instructions/installation-python-interface-windows.md) file.
- Linux in [this](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/linear-arrangement-library/blob/master/instructions/installation-python-interface-linux.md) file.
