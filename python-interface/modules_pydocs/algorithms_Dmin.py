The different algorithms for computing the minimum sum of the length of the edges :math:`D` 

This enumeration's values are used to choose the algorithm which the functions ``lal.linarr.Dmin`` use to compute the minimum value of the sum of the length the edges :math:`D` 

Algorithms for rooted trees
---------------------------

- Algorithm to calculate optimal projective arrangements of rooted trees.

	Value: ``Projective``

	Computes an optimal projective linear arrangement for rooted trees. A projective linear arrangement is an arrangement in which there are no edge crossings and the root is not covered by any edge.

	This option implements the algorithm in [1]. A non-linear time algorithm to solve this problem was oulined in [2].

	Preconditions:
	
	* The input rooted tree has to have the size of its subtrees calculated (see ``lal.graphs.rooted_tree.calculate_size_subtrees`` and ``lal.graphs.rooted_tree.size_subtrees_valid``).


Algorithms for free trees
-------------------------

- Algorithm to calculate optimal planar arrangements of free trees.

	Value: ``Planar``

	Computes an optimal planar linear arrangement for free trees. A planar linear arrangement is an arrangement in which there are no edge crossings.

	This implements the algorithm published by Hochberg and Stallmann [3]. A previous algorithm solving the same problem was published by Iordanskii [4]. See [1] for a review.

- Algorithm to calculate unconstrained an optimal linearization of free trees.

	Value: ``Unconstrained_YS``

	Computes an unconstrained optimal linear arrangement of a free tree and the value of its cost, i.e., the sum of the lengths of the edges.

	This implements Yossi Shiloach's algorithm published in [5]. The implementation of this algorithm applies the corrections published in [6].

- Algorithm to calculate unconstrained an optimal linearization of free trees.

	Value: ``Unconstrained_FC``

	Computes an unconstrained optimal linear arrangement of a free tree and the value of its cost, i.e., the sum of the lengths of the edges.

	This implements Fan Chung's quadratic algorithm (Section 3) published in [7].
