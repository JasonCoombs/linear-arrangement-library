NAMING OF CLASSES AND FUNCTIONS
===============================

- We allow the following shorthands

	SHORTHAND			MEANING

	'rand'				random
	'min'				minimum
	'max'				maximum
	'exp'				expected (as in expected value of a random variable)
	'var'				variance (as in variance of a random variable)

We favor the shorthands in the left column over those in the right column

	'mean'				'avg'

- Classes that should not be used by users start with an underscore '_'

- We use snake case

- The name of the function should be self-explanatory.
