# Installation of the binaries (Windows)

You should have been provided with three folders
- `docs`: this contains the Doxygen documentation for the C++ code.
- `include`: this contains the header files `.hpp` of the C++ code.
- `bin`: this contains several `.pyd` and `.py` files, and two `.dll` files.

Alternatively, place the `include` and `bin` folders in a directory of your choice, say, `C:/L/A/L/` so that,

	C:/L/A/L/include       contains several `.hpp` files
	C:/L/A/L/bin           contains two `.dll` files, and several `.pyd` and `.py` files

Both directories should be added to the environment variables `PATH`, and the latter only to `PYTHONPATH`.
